"""
This script reads from stdin line by line and computes metrics from the input.

The input format is expected to be:
<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>

If the input format is not as expected, the line is skipped.

After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C),
the script prints the following statistics from the beginning:

1. Total file size: File size: <total size>
   where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size>

2. Number of lines by status code:
   Possible status codes: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
   If a status code doesnâ€™t appear or is not an integer,
    nothing is printed for this status code
   The format is: <status code>: <number>
   Status codes are printed in ascending order

Note:
The script assumes that the input is provided via stdin,
 such as by redirection from a file.
